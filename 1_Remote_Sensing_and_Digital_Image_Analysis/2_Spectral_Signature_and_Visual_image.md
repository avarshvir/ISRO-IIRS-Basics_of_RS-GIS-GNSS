# Spectral Signatures of Different Land cover Features and  Visual Image interpretation 

### Spectral Signature?
- A spectral signature in remote sensing refers to the specific pattern of electromagnetic radiation that an object reflects, absorbs, or emits across different wavelengths. Every material, such as vegetation, water, soil, or man-made objects, interacts with light in a unique way, producing a distinct spectral signature.

### Image Interpretation?
- Image interpretation is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful information from images, particularly those obtained through remote sensing or other imaging technologies. This process involves identifying, classifying, and understanding various features, patterns, and objects within an image based on their characteristics and context.

### Data characterstics
- Spectral Resolution
- Radiometric Resolution
- Spatial Resolution
- Temporal Resolution

### Pros of using images over ground observation.
- Symoptic view
- Permanent Record
- Resolutions
- Cost & Time Effective.
- Stereoscopic view

### What is Spectral Reflactance Curve?
- A spectral reflectance curve is a graph that represents the reflectance of a material as a function of wavelength. It shows how much light at different wavelengths is reflected by a surface or object. The curve is unique to each material, providing a "spectral signature" that can be used to identify and differentiate between different materials based on how they interact with light.

### Spectral Significance of Vegetation?
- Green colour due to chlorophyll.
- Thick leaves and Thin leaves seen differently.

### Spectral Significance of Soil?
- moisture content, organic content, structure, iron-oxide content, texture.
- wet soil is more darker than dry soil.
- clay soil have more moisture and strong structure than sandy soil.

### Spectral Significance of Water?
- Reflection of Lights - Wavelength.
- Water depth - shallow, deep
- Chlorophyll content
- Surface Roughness

### Spectral Significance of Snow?
- Grain size.
- Snow pack thickness.
- Liquid water content.
