# Basics Principle of Remote Sensing

### How to Collect Scientific Data?
- <b>Method 1</b> <i> Go to site, collect the sample and analyze it. It is also called field data collection.</i>
- <b>Method 2</b> <i> Remote Sensing -> collect data from remote location.</i>

### What is Remote Sensing?
- The Science and Art of obtaining information about object, area, or phenonmenon through the analysis of data acquired by device that is not with physical contact with the object, area, or phenonmenon under investigation.

### Why Remote Sensing?
- Systematic Data Collection.
- Information about 3 Dimentional of real objects.
- Repeatability.
- Global coverage
- Multipurpose.
- Used in inaccessible areas.

### Remote Sensing Process.
- Sun as a passive remote sensing.
- Sun -> Target -> Satelite -> Ground Reciever -> PreProceesing & Analysis -> Application.

### Properties of EM radiations
- 

### How EM interact with matter?
- <b> There are two theories: </b>
- <i> Wave Theory -> consider EM as a continuous harmonic, sinusoidal wave.</i>
- <i> Partical Theory -> consider EM as consisting of many discrete units photons. </i>

### EMR propagation as wave
- 

### Term associated with wave Theory
- <b>Crest: </b> <i> The highest point of wave.</i>
- <b>Trough: </b> <i> The lowest point of wave.</i>
- <b>Wavelength: </b> <i> The distance between two identical points. </i>
- <b>Frequency: </b> <i> The no. of wavelength that pass a point in a set period of time.</i>

### Speed of Light.
- c = wavelength*V
- where V is frequency and C is speed of light.
- C = 3X10^8

### EMR: Particle nature.
- E = hv
- =hc/wavelength
- h = 6.62 X 10^-34 joules/sec

### Wave-Particle duality
- wavelength = h/p
- h is plank's constant

### EM Spectrum
- -------------------------------> Incresing Wavelength
- -------------------------------> Decreasing Frequency
- VIBGYOR
- Cosmic rays - y rays - X rays -  IR - Micro waves - Radio Waves

### EMR interaction with matter
- <b> At boundary of surface </b>
- - Reflection
- - - Specular
- - - Diffused
- - Refraction
- <b> within medium </b>
- - Absorption
- - Scattering
