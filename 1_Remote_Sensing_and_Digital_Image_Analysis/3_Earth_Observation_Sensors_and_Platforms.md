# Earth Observation Sensors and Platforms

<p>We are sensing energy that is EM energy either it is reflected, emitted, or backscatter.</p>

<p>RS sensors which are used for earth observation purposes they can work beyound that wavelength. It can use IR, thermal IR, and mmicrowave.</p>

### Sensors and Platforms that are used to create image data of the earth.
### Sensor:
<p>A device that records EM energy</p>

### Platform:
<p>Carrier bed used to carry a sensor</p>
<p>Such as Groundbased, Airborne, Spaceborne</p>

### Satellite Referencing Scheme
<p>A Satellite Referencing Scheme refers to the methods and protocols used for locating, communicating with, and referencing satellites in space for various purposes such as communication, navigation, Earth observation, and more</p>
- Path : Path refers to the satellite's orbital track, which is the north-south trajectory that the satellite follows as it orbits the Earth.
- Row : Row refers to the position of the satellite along its east-west swath, which represents how far the satellite is in its orbit when taking an image.
- Swath : A swath in satellite terminology refers to the strip of the Earth's surface that a satellite sensor observes or images during a single pass over the Earth. It represents the width of the area that the satellite captures as it moves along its orbit. Essentially, it's the ground area covered by the satellite's sensors in one pass.

### Satellite Orbital Characterstics
- Altitude
- Inclination Angle
- Period
- Repeat Cycle
- Swath
- Ascending path & Descending path.

<p><b>Altitude : </b> Definition: The altitude is the height of the satellite above the Earth’s surface. It is measured from the Earth's surface to the satellite’s position in orbit.</p>
